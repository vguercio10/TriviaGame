### How to create this game
* To begin you'll need to layout your format with HTML. 
* Then you will need to use Javascript to create your logic. Remember, you will need to create a timer, questions with answers,and scoreboard which displays the users correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questons. 
* You will also need to use JQuery to dynamically manipulate the HTML. 
* After this add some styling to your page! I used Bootstrap, Google Fonts, and a background image.
